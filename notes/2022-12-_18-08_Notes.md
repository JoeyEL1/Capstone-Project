1. - What is it?
  
I created a basic shop using the "https://fakestoreapi.com/". Within it I created a wishlist, a about us page and a contact form page with a navigation
bar to go throughout the website with ease.

2. - What did you use?

A combination of html, css, js and very light sass.

3. - What was the API and how did you use it?

I used the "https://fakestoreapi.com/" to get the id of each random product and display the relative information on the website including the Title, brief description and price. Used the Javascript to the call the APi info and sort it by newest on the front homepage. I tried to create a user and login area but got very confused very quick.

4. - How was the CSS?

Pain.

5. - Future Features?

Getting the wishlist and add cart buttons to actually work and add an account login that stores your shopping cart per the account.
